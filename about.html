     <h3 style="color: white;font-family: Arial;position:relative;top:-180px;""><center>Born in Ontario, Colby grew up fascinated with computers and technology, 
      He vividly remembers being inspired by his father's love for electronics, which 
      stemmed his interest in computer science. When Colby was five, his family
      bought their first desktop computer resulting in his explosion into the realm
      of computing. At the age of seven, Colby said goodbye to his Ontario friends
      and moved away to Newfoundland & Labrador, where he would continue to 
      pursue his passion in various robotics teams along with competitions. Colby
      has earned several awards for his hard work as well as leadership in STEAM
      related fields.<br><br>
      
      This combined with his highly-regarded positions inside the Sea Cadet program
      molded him into an innovative leader at the Canadian Robotics league as well
      as Airntell Aerospace, a startup company that deploys autonomous UAV systems
      for SAR operations. On top of this, he is also a Boatswain in the Royal Canadian
      Naval Reserve. A position in which he excelled in thanks to the Cadet program.<br><br>
      
      Colby is a dedicated individual who will use his leadership to see any task through,
      no matter the scale. His work along with mentorship has proven this countless times,
      making him an effective member of any team or organization. </center></h3>
